# Experimental Results Documentation

Code needed for reproducing the experimental results is kept in the jupyter notebook file [code/Experimental_Results/experimental_results.ipynb](https://github.com/twytock/DrugCombPred/code/Experimental_Results/experimental_results.ipynb).
The notebook can be launched by navigating to the top-level directory of this repository, typing `jupyter notebook code/Experimental_Results/experimental_results.ipynb` in the terminal.
This command will launch a Jupyter notebook in your default web browser. 
Jupyter notebooks consist of cells that can be executed independently by clicking on a cell and pressing "Shift+Enter". 
This notebook is designed so that the cells can be executed in order.
To generate all of the relevant figures, click on the "Run" menu tab near the top of the window and navigate to the "Run All" option.
The subheadings within the notebook indicate the portions of the code necessary for obtaining the figures from the [input data](https://github.com/twytock/DrugCombPred/data/Experimental_Results/).
